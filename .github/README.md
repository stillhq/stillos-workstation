## Contributing - Code and Design

This project is a template for starting new Atomic AlmaLinux respins.

Before submitting code changes, please check if there are any open issues or pull requests that cover your proposal. If not, open an issue with a brief description and so you can discuss it with us first. This helps avoid duplicated work and ensures proposed changes align with project goals. This can be your anticipated workflow:

- Create an issue describing your changes.
- Await confirmation from contributors.
- Fork the project.
- Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
- Add your code, documentation, etc.
- Submit a pull request (PR). All PRs should target the `main` branch.

After review and approval, the changes will be merged and deployed.

## Reporting a Bug

2. If no similar request exists, open a new issue. Please clearly explain why the feature is needed and provide a detailed use case.
